# Advisory T2 check: a patch that touches nl-shell's security-relevant code or contracts
# should also update .oss-scanner/threat_model.md (the threat model's own rule, and the
# rubric the security-review leaf rates against). Not gating: a change can be security-
# relevant by path without changing the threat model. When the rule isn't met, report
# PDCA-UNVERIFIABLE (exit 77) so it lands in SUMMARY §6 for the human to judge.
